# ðŸ¥› Milk Business Transaction App for NW Share

I developed a **milk trading application** using **Android Studio** and **Flutter** for NW Share, a nonprofit organization. The app enables real-time tracking of milk stock traded between customers and the organization.

## Key Features

- **Stock Updates**: 
   - The app tracks milk given and received from customers, ensuring accurate and up-to-date stock information.

- **Google Sheets Integration**: 
   - Utilizes the **Google Sheets API** to automatically update stock data in real-time, allowing the business owner to monitor and analyze orders directly in Google Sheets.

This app streamlines the milk trading process, helping NW Share manage their service more efficiently.
